Administrative notes for CTAN upload:

  - The distribution contains 7 .bbl files, which are there to enable
    users to build documentation or examples.

  - Directory src/security-patches ...

  - The distribution contains many files with duplicate basenames,
    e.g., noidx.nw, noindex.nw, noroots.nw, and so on.  These
    different files have identical basenames because they provide
    identical functionality on different platforms, or because they
    provide documentation of that functionality.  For example,

      src/awk/noindex.nw          Index building on Unix using Awk
      src/icon/noindex.nw         Index building on Unix using Icon
      contrib/rsc/rc/noindex.nw   Index building using the Plan 9 shell RC
      xdoc/noindex.nw             Man page for index building
      
    None of these files is ever exposed to kpathsea or to TeX, so name
    clashes should not be a problem.

  - The distribution includes TeX source for two papers about Noweb: a
    1991 technical report and a 1993 submission to IEEE Software.
    Both .tex files refer to information that is no longer current,
    including the obsolete FTP server ftp.tex.ac.uk.  Because the
    intent of the distribution is to provide interested readers with
    access to these documents as they were published, these references
    will not be changed.
