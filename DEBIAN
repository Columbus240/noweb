Anyone may modify noweb and create derived works, provided he or she
retains this copyright notice, but the result may not be called
noweb without my written consent.  I hereby provide my written
consent to the Debian project to call their derived work 'noweb'.
I do so under the assumption that Debian's modifications are
normally intended to fix bugs, close security holes, and bring the
software into compliance with Debian policy.  I have a great deal of
trust in and respect for the Debian project, so I am in fact willing
for the Debian project to make any modification they deem necessary
and still call the result 'noweb'.  In particular, there is no need
for the Debian project to consult me about any contemplated
modification, either now or in the future.  I do reserve the right
to revoke my consent in the unlikely event that, in my opinion,
future Debian modifications will have made it misleading to call the
package 'noweb'.
