To build noweb:

  1) Bourne shell implementations differ, with the unfortunate result
     that there is no standard way to print one backslash on standard
     output.  The latest strategy I have tried is to use
     `echo -n \\' by itself for backslashes; this fails on SYSV
     echo which doesn't recognize -n.  You may have to alter
     bin/noweave to get correct TeX goo.

  2) Choose locations for the noweb files, and set the appropriate
     variables in the Makefile:
       BIN        on $PATH, will hold notangle, noweave, noroots, ...
       LIB        a place to store markup, unmarkup and nt
       MAN        notangle man page will go in $MAN/man1
       TEXINPUTS  a place TeX will look for nwmac.tex and nwkernel.tex
     Make sure you have write permission to these places.
     Set CC in the Makefile to point to an ANSI C compiler.

  3) If you have Icon and want to use its superior cross-referencer,
     try 'icont -o lib/noxref icon/noxref.icn'.  \chunklist
     on a line by itself expands to a list of chunks (`module index').

  4) Fasten your seat belt and type `make'.  If you want a nonstandard
     noweave, you can use the WEAVE variable in the Makefile; for example,
     I use `make WEAVE=noweave.nr'.

Instead of editing the Makefile, you can create a shell script that
invokes make with the proper variables.  `nwmake' is an example of
such a script; I use it to install noweb at Princeton using the Icon
cross-referencer and our local C compiler.  If you make your own
script, call it something else so it won't get overwritten by the
default nwmake.
