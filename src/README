`noweb' is built from pieces, which are then assembled in pipelines
using shell scripts.  Three important pieces are:

   markup	convert noweb file from human syntax to program syntax
   unmarkup	inverse of markup, or nearly so
   nt		`tangle' the program form of the noweb file

These pieces are pipelined with various awk and sed scripts by the
following Bourne shell scripts

  notangle.sh	script for notangle
  noweave.sh	script for noweave
  nountangle.sh	script for nountangle
  noroots.sh	script for noroots

noweb is written in ANSI C, so an ANSI C compiler is required.  
To build noweb:

  1) Right after unbundling the distribution: `make boot'.  This sets
     the timestamps right so noweb can be booted from the distributed
     C code.

  2) To make local versions of nt and markup: `make all'.

  3) Bourne shell implementations differ, with the unfortunate result
     that there is no standard way to print one backslash on standard
     output.  The latest strategy I have tried is to use
     `echo -n \\' by itself for backslashes.

  4) Choose locations for the noweb files, and set the appropriate
     variables in the Makefile:
       BIN	  on $PATH, will hold notangle, noweave, luddite
       LIB	  a place to store markup, unmarkup and nt
       MAN	  notangle man page will go in $MAN/man1
       TEXINPUTS  a place TeX will look for nwmac.tex and nwkernel.tex
     Make sure you have write permission to these places, then `make
     install'.  This should install the various pieces and so on.

Notes: 

  Using noweb with latex has not been thoroughly debugged.  noweave -l
  is set up to make a single latex document, not a chapter.

  If you want to tinker with the appearance of the output, nwmac.tex
  can be changed at will, but nwkernel.tex should not be changed
  unless you know what you're doing.

  tose.* contains a paper that has been submitted to the IEEE
  Transactions on Software Engineering.  The representation discussed
  in that paper (and emitted by markup) is not yet documented anywhere.

  If you're interested in other tools (e.g. prettyprinters, index
  generators), let me know.
