This is version 2.0 of `noweb', a low-tech literate programming tool.
In this version I changed the low-level representation of noweb files
to make it easier to implement tools.  This version is upward
compatible with previous versions of noweb, but with the following
changes:
  noweave is much more reliable
  two new tools, nountangle and noroots, have been added
  some tools support new command-line options

`noweb' is built from pieces, which are then assembled in pipelines
using shell scripts.  Three important pieces are:

  markup	convert noweb file from human syntax to tool syntax
  unmarkup	inverse of markup
  nt		`tangle' the tool form of the noweb file

These pieces are pipelined with various awk and sed scripts by the
following Bourne shell scripts

  notangle.sh	script for notangle
  noweave.sh	script for noweave
  nountangle.sh	script for nountangle
  noroots.sh	script for noroots

nt and markup are written in ANSI C, so an ANSI C compiler is
required.  To build noweb:

  1) Right after unbundling the distribution: `make boot'.  This sets
     the timestamps right so noweb can be booted from the distributed
     C code.

  2) To make local versions of nt and markup: `make all'.

  3) Bourne shell implementations differ, with the unfortunate result
     that there is no standard way to print one backslash on standard
     output.  The latest strategy I have tried is to use
     `echo -n \\' by itself for backslashes; this fails on SYSV
     echo which doesn't recognize -n.  You may have to alter
     noweave.sh to get correct TeX goo.

  4) Choose locations for the noweb files, and set the appropriate
     variables in the Makefile:
       BIN	  on $PATH, will hold notangle, noweave, noroots, ...
       LIB	  a place to store markup, unmarkup and nt
       MAN	  notangle man page will go in $MAN/man1
       TEXINPUTS  a place TeX will look for nwmac.tex and nwkernel.tex
     Make sure you have write permission to these places, then `make
     install'.  This should install the various pieces and so on.

Notes: 

  Using noweb with latex has not been thoroughly exercised.
  noweave -l is set up to make a single latex document, not a chapter.

  If you want to tinker with the appearance of the output, nwmac.tex
  can be changed at will, but nwkernel.tex should not be changed
  unless you know what you're doing (and you change noweave.sh).

  tose.* contains a paper that has been submitted to the IEEE
  Transactions on Software Engineering.  You must `make install'
  before attempting to format the paper, since it uses the noweb
  document style option.

  representation.tex documents the representation of noweb files that
  is used by the noweb tools, in case you want to write any tools of
  your own.  Simple tools (e.g. count the number of lines of
  interleaved documentation) are trivial.  If you write any tools, or
  you want tools written (e.g. prettyprinters, index generators), let
  me know.

noweb users; if you have enjoyed noweb, why not send me a local
